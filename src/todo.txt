Change recursive ASTNode traversal to an iterraive process

Cosntruct an array of ASTNode* that represent the expressions in the statement
Dont do any actual work during this phase just determine what needs to be done and
store the nodes in the array in the order in which they need to be processed.

Finally iterrate over the array linearly
